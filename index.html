    	<h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>5 Minute Me is a simple tool that will help you get to know your circle of coworkers, which will facilitate connections and unity within your office.</p>
		    <p>Working with a group of people who know each other makes for a more enjoyable day-to-day work experience. It’s fun to find out what we have in common with each other, and in turn we enjoy working together more and our workplace becomes more effective.</p>
		    <p>5 Minute Me offers a fun and time-friendly forum which allows the shyest and most introvert among your coworkers to share a bit about himself/herself, and helps others learn what makes each person unique. </p>

    	<h2>Implementation</h2>
    
		  <p>The 5 Minute Me download comes with an outline to print out and give each coworker the week before his/her "5 Minute Me", which gives them a list of ideas to base their 5 minutes on. The program itself can be form-fitted to your office. For example, it can be done during a weekly meeting, allowing one pre-assigned person to take 5 minutes to help everyone get to know him/her better. The 5 Minute Me-er can bring in any photos or props that help explain more about himself/herself. At the end, they can hand off the baton (i.e., a clock) to the person that will go the following week.</p> 
		  <p>5 Minute Me is not meant to pressure people to entertain the group, but to make people more real, work more interesting, and coworkers more connected. This is the ideal connection creator for any office, the grown-up, cool-kid professional version of a grade school spotlight, guaranteed to make your office more interesting than it was last week.</p>
